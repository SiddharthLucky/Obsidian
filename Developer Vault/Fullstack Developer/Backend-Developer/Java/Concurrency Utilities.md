Mastery of threads, the `java.util.concurrent` package, synchronisation, and concurrent data structures. 

***Executor Factory****: Executor factory is a pattern that centralizes thread pool management and provides a way to create different types of executors.
	1. **Centralized Control**: By using an executor factory, you can have centralized control over the thread pool settings, making it easier to manage and monitor.
	2. **Flexibility**: Executor factory provides flexibility in creating different types of executors, such as single-thread executor, cached thread pool, fixed thread pool, and scheduled thread pool.
	3. **Better Resource Management**: By using an executor factory, you can efficiently manage resources. It allows you to control the number of threads in a pool, which can lead to better system performance.
	4. **Graceful Shutdown**: Executor factories provide methods for shutting down the executors gracefully, which is important for preventing resource leaks.

***Message Queues***: Message queues are a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architectures, providing a robust, scalable, and decoupled way of exchanging information.
	    1. **Why Introduced**: Message queues were introduced to handle asynchronous operations in a distributed system. They provide a way to decouple the sender and receiver, allowing them to communicate without being connected at the same time. This makes the system more robust and scalable.
	    2. **Important Interview Questions**:
	        - What is a Message Queue and what problem does it solve?
	            - A Message Queue is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architectures. It solves the problem of communication between processes, systems, or servers by providing a reliable, scalable, and asynchronous way of exchanging information.
	        - Can you explain how a Message Queue works?
	            - A Message Queue works by storing messages sent by the producer until they are processed or consumed by the receiver. The producer sends a message to the queue and continues its tasks without waiting for the message to be processed. The consumer retrieves the messages from the queue when it's ready to process them.
	        - Can you provide some examples of where you would use a Message Queue?
	            - Message Queues are commonly used in scenarios where you need to decouple processing from the producer, handle variable workloads, ensure data is not lost due to system failures, or distribute tasks among multiple workers. For example, in e-commerce systems, when a customer places an order, the order details can be added to a queue to be processed separately, ensuring the user interface remains responsive.
	        - What are some popular Message Queue systems and how do they differ?
	            - Some popular Message Queue systems include Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, AWS SQS, and Google Cloud Pub/Sub. They differ in terms of their features, scalability, delivery guarantees, and the protocols they support.
	        - Can you explain the difference between point-to-point and publish-subscribe messaging systems?
	            - Point-to-point messaging systems are based on the concept of queues where the messages are sent by a producer to a specific consumer. On the other hand, publish-subscribe messaging systems are based on the concept of topics. In this model, messages are sent by publishers to topics, and then delivered to all subscribed consumers.
