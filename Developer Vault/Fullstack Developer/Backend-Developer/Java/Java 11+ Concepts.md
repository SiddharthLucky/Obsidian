#Java-Concepts 

1. **Local Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters (Java 11)**
    
    - Allows using `var` in lambda parameters for local variable type inference.
    
    ```java
    // Before Java 11
    (String s) -> s.length();
    
    // After Java 11
    (var s) -> s.length();
    
    ```
    
    **Interview Question**: What is the benefit of using `var` in lambda parameters introduced in Java 11? **Answer**: Using `var` in lambda parameters enhances code readability and consistency with local variable type inference.
    
2. **Switch Expressions (Java 12)**
    
    - Enhances switch statements with new expression form, enabling concise case statements.
    
    ```java
    int numLetters = switch (day) {
        case MONDAY, FRIDAY, SUNDAY -> 6;
        case TUESDAY                -> 7;
        case THURSDAY, SATURDAY     -> 8;
        case WEDNESDAY              -> 9;
        default                     -> throw new IllegalStateException("Invalid day: " + day);
    };
    
    ```
    
    **Interview Question**: How do switch expressions improve code readability in Java 12? **Answer**: Switch expressions allow for more concise and readable case statements by using expressions instead of statements.
    
3. **Text Blocks (Java 13)**
    
    - Introduces multi-line string literals to simplify string formatting.
    
    ```java
    String textBlock = """
        {
            "name": "John",
            "age": 30
        }
        """;
    
    ```
    
    **Interview Question**: What are text blocks in Java 13, and how do they simplify string handling? **Answer**: Text blocks allow for multi-line string literals, simplifying the creation and formatting of multi-line strings without escape sequences.
    
4. **Pattern Matching for instanceof (Java 14)**
    
    - Simplifies type checks and casting in a single expression.
    
    ```java
    if (obj instanceof String s) {
        System.out.println(s.toUpperCase());
    }
    
    ```
    
    **Interview Question**: What is the advantage of pattern matching for `instanceof` introduced in Java 14? **Answer**: Pattern matching for `instanceof` reduces boilerplate code by combining type checking and casting in a single expression.
    
5. **Records (Java 16)**
    
    - Provides a compact syntax for declaring classes that are transparent holders for shallowly immutable data.
    
    ```java
    public record Point(int x, int y) {}
    
    ```
    
    **Interview Question**: What are records in Java 16, and when should they be used? **Answer**: Records provide a concise way to create data carrier classes with automatically generated boilerplate code such as constructors, getters, equals, hashCode, and toString methods.
    
6. **Sealed Classes (Java 17)**
    
    - Restricts which classes can extend or implement a class or interface.
    
    ```java
    public abstract sealed class Shape permits Circle, Square {}
    public final class Circle extends Shape {}
    public final class Square extends Shape {}
    
    ```
    
    **Interview Question**: How do sealed classes introduced in Java 17 enhance type safety? **Answer**: Sealed classes enhance type safety by explicitly specifying which classes are allowed to extend or implement them, providing better control over the class hierarchy.
    
7. **Enhanced Pseudorandom Number Generators (Java 17)**
    
    - Adds new interfaces and implementations for pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs).
    
    ```java
    RandomGenerator random = RandomGenerator.of("L64X128MixRandom");
    int randomValue = random.nextInt();
    
    ```
    
    **Interview Question**: What improvements do enhanced pseudorandom number generators in Java 17 provide? **Answer**: Enhanced PRNGs offer more flexible and robust random number generation with new algorithms and improved performance.
    
8. **Vector API (Incubator) (Java 16)**
    
    - Provides an API for expressing vector computations that reliably compile to optimal vector instructions on supported hardware.
    
    ```java
    VectorSpecies<Integer> SPECIES = IntVector.SPECIES_256;
    IntVector vector = IntVector.fromArray(SPECIES, intArray, 0);
    
    ```
    
    **Interview Question**: What is the Vector API in Java 16, and how does it benefit performance? **Answer**: The Vector API allows for efficient vector computations that can be compiled to optimal hardware instructions, enhancing performance for data-parallel operations.
