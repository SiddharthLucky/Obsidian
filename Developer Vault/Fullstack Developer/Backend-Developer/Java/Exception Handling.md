Exception handling in Java is a powerful mechanism that is used to handle runtime errors, maintain normal application flow, and avoid program termination.

- **Exception Handling Techniques in Java**:
    
    1. **Try-Catch-Finally Blocks**: The most common way to handle exceptions. The try block contains code that might throw an exception, the catch block handles the exception, and the finally block includes code that is always executed, whether an exception occurs or not.
        
        - **Sample Code Snippet for Exception Handling in Java:**
            
            ```java
            public class ExceptionHandlingExample {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    try {
                        int divideByZero = 5 / 0;
                        System.out.println("Rest of code in try block");
                    }
                    catch (ArithmeticException e) {
                        System.out.println("ArithmeticException => " + e.getMessage());
                    }
                    finally {
                        System.out.println("This is the finally block");
                    }
                }
            }
            
            ```
            
            In the above code, we are dividing an integer by zero, which is not allowed in mathematics, and hence, we are expecting an `ArithmeticException` to occur. This exception is caught in the `catch` block. The `finally` block executes regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.
            
    2. **Throws Keyword**: Used to declare an exception. It gives information to the caller of the method about the exception.
        
        - **Throws Keyword:**
            
            Here's a simple example of how the `throws` keyword can be used in Java:
            
            ```java
            public class ThrowsExample {
                static void method() throws NullPointerException {
                    throw new NullPointerException("Demo");
                }
            
                public static void main(String args[]) {
                    try {
                        method();
                    } catch (NullPointerException e) {
                        System.out.println("Caught inside main : " + e.getMessage());
                    }
                }
            }
            
            ```
            
            In this example, the `method()` function throws a `NullPointerException`, which is caught and handled in the `main()` function.
            
    3. **Throw Keyword**: Used to explicitly throw an exception.
        
        - **Throw Keyword:**
            
            Here's a simple example of how the `throw` keyword can be used in Java:
            
            ```java
            public class ThrowExample {
                static void validateAge(int age) {
                    if(age < 18) {
                        throw new ArithmeticException("Not eligible for voting");
                    } else {
                        System.out.println("Eligible for voting");
                    }
                }
            
                public static void main(String args[]) {
                    validateAge(13);
                }
            }
            
            ```
            
            In this example, if the age is less than 18, we are throwing an `ArithmeticException`, otherwise we print a message saying the person is eligible for voting.
            
    4. **Custom Exceptions**: Java allows us to create our own exceptions which are basically derived classes of Exception.
        
        - **Custom Exceptions:**
            
            ```java
            // Custom exception class
            public class InvalidAgeException extends Exception {
                // Constructor that accepts a message
                public InvalidAgeException(String message) {
                    super(message);
                }
            }
            ```
            
            ```java
            public class Main {
                // Method that throws the custom exception
                public static void validateAge(int age) throws InvalidAgeException {
                    if (age < 18) {
                        throw new InvalidAgeException("Age must be 18 or older.");
                    } else {
                        System.out.println("Age is valid.");
                    }
                }
            
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    try {
                        validateAge(15); // This will throw an exception
                    } catch (InvalidAgeException e) {
                        System.out.println("Caught an exception: " + e.getMessage());
                    }
            
                    try {
                        validateAge(20); // This will not throw an exception
                    } catch (InvalidAgeException e) {
                        System.out.println("Caught an exception: " + e.getMessage());
                    }
                }
            }
            ```
            
            ### **Explanation**
            
            1. **Custom Exception Class**: **`InvalidAgeException`** extends **`Exception`**. It includes a constructor that accepts a message, which is passed to the superclass constructor.
            2. **Validation Method**: **`validateAge(int age)`** checks the age and throws an **`InvalidAgeException`** if the age is less than 18.
            3. **Main Method**: Demonstrates how to use the **`validateAge`** method and handle the custom exception using a try-catch block.
    5. **Chained Exceptions**: This refers to one exception causing another exception.
        
        - **Chained Exceptions:**
            
            ```java
            // Custom exception class for application-specific errors
            public class ApplicationException extends Exception {
                public ApplicationException(String message, Throwable cause) {
                    super(message, cause);
                }
            }
            
            // Custom exception class for database errors
            public class DatabaseException extends Exception {
                public DatabaseException(String message, Throwable cause) {
                    super(message, cause);
                }
            }
            ```
            
            ```java
            public class Main {
                // Method that simulates a database operation and throws a DatabaseException
                public static void simulateDatabaseOperation() throws DatabaseException {
                    try {
                        // Simulate a lower-level exception (e.g., SQL exception)
                        throw new SQLException("Unable to connect to database.");
                    } catch (SQLException e) {
                        // Wrap the lower-level exception in a custom exception
                        throw new DatabaseException("Database operation failed.", e);
                    }
                }
            
                // Method that simulates an application operation and throws an ApplicationException
                public static void simulateApplicationOperation() throws ApplicationException {
                    try {
                        simulateDatabaseOperation();
                    } catch (DatabaseException e) {
                        // Wrap the lower-level exception in another custom exception
                        throw new ApplicationException("Application encountered an error.", e);
                    }
                }
            
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    try {
                        simulateApplicationOperation();
                    } catch (ApplicationException e) {
                        // Print the top-level exception message
                        System.out.println("Caught an exception: " + e.getMessage());
                        // Print the cause of the top-level exception
                        Throwable cause = e.getCause();
                        if (cause != null) {
                            System.out.println("Caused by: " + cause.getMessage());
                            // Further unwrap the cause if needed
                            Throwable rootCause = cause.getCause();
                            if (rootCause != null) {
                                System.out.println("Root cause: " + rootCause.getMessage());
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            ```
            
            ### **Explanation**
            
            1. **Custom Exception Classes**: **`ApplicationException`** and **`DatabaseException`** extend **`Exception`** and include constructors that accept a message and a cause (another **`Throwable`**).
            2. **Database Operation Simulation**: **`simulateDatabaseOperation()`** throws a **`SQLException`**, which is caught and wrapped in a **`DatabaseException`**.
            3. **Application Operation Simulation**: **`simulateApplicationOperation()`** calls **`simulateDatabaseOperation()`**, catching any **`DatabaseException`** and wrapping it in an **`ApplicationException`**.
            4. **Main Method**: Calls **`simulateApplicationOperation()`** and catches **`ApplicationException`**. It prints the top-level exception message, the cause, and the root cause, demonstrating how to trace back through the chain of exceptions.
    6. **Multi-Catch Block**: This feature allows us to catch multiple exceptions in a single catch block.
        
        - **Chained Exceptions:**
            
            ```java
            public class Main {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    try {
                        // Example code that may throw multiple types of exceptions
                        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
                        System.out.println(numbers[5]); // This will throw ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
            
                        String text = null;
                        System.out.println(text.length()); // This will throw NullPointerException
            
                        int result = 10 / 0; // This will throw ArithmeticException
                    } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
                        System.out.println("Caught an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: " + e.getMessage());
                    } catch (NullPointerException e) {
                        System.out.println("Caught a NullPointerException: " + e.getMessage());
                    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
                        System.out.println("Caught an ArithmeticException: " + e.getMessage());
                    }
                }
            }
            ```
            
            ### **Explanation**
            
            1. **Try Block**: Contains code that may throw multiple types of exceptions. In this example, accessing an invalid array index, invoking a method on a **`null`** reference, and dividing by zero are used to demonstrate different exceptions.
            2. **Catch Blocks**: Each **`catch`** block is designed to handle a specific type of exception:
                - **`ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`** is caught when accessing an invalid array index.
                - **`NullPointerException`** is caught when invoking a method on a **`null`** reference.
                - **`ArithmeticException`** is caught when dividing by zero.
            3. **Exception Handling**: Each **`catch`** block prints a message indicating the type of exception that was caught and the associated error message.
    7. **Try-With-Resources**: This feature allows us to declare resources to be used in a try block with the assurance that the resources will be closed when they are no longer needed.
        
        - **Try With Resources:**
            
            It ensures that resources are closed automatically at the end of the statement.
            
            ```java
            import java.io.BufferedReader;
            import java.io.FileReader;
            import java.io.IOException;
            
            public class Main {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    // Path to the file
                    String filePath = "example.txt";
            
                    // Using try-with-resources to ensure BufferedReader is closed automatically
                    try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
                        String line;
                        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
                            System.out.println(line);
                        }
                    } catch (IOException e) {
                        System.out.println("Caught an IOException: " + e.getMessage());
                    }
                }
            }
            ```
            
            ### **Explanation**
            
            1. **File Path**: The **`filePath`** variable holds the path to the file to be read.
            2. **Try-With-Resources**: The **`try`** statement declares a **`BufferedReader`** resource, which is initialized with a **`FileReader`** pointing to the specified file.
                - **`BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))`**: This statement opens the file for reading.
            3. **Automatic Resource Management**: The **`BufferedReader`** is declared in the parentheses of the **`try`** statement, ensuring it is automatically closed at the end of the **`try`** block, regardless of whether an exception is thrown.
            4. **Reading the File**: The **`while`** loop reads lines from the file and prints them to the console.
            5. **Catch Block**: If an **`IOException`** occurs during file reading, it is caught and handled by printing an error message.
- **Exception Handling in Spring Applications**:
    
    Spring provides a convenient API for translating technology-specific exceptions into unchecked, consistent exceptions. Key points are:
    
    - `@ExceptionHandler` annotation: It is used at the method level to handle specific exceptions thrown by request handling methods.
    - `@ControllerAdvice`: This annotation allows you to handle exceptions across the whole application, not just to an individual controller. You can think of it as an interceptor of exceptions.
    - `ResponseEntityExceptionHandler`: It is a convenient base class for controller advice classes. It provides methods to handle internal Spring exceptions.
    - `HandlerExceptionResolver`: It provides a centralized location for handling exceptions that are thrown from all the controllers.
- **Possible Interview Questions with Answers**:
    
    - What is an exception in Java?
        - An exception in Java is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program’s instructions. These are unwanted events that occur during the execution of a program, i.e., computation in a program.
    - What are the types of exceptions in Java?
        - There are two types of exceptions in Java: checked and unchecked. Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time, while unchecked exceptions are checked at runtime.
    - How to create a custom exception in Java?
        - To create a custom exception, we need to create a new class that extends the `Exception` class or any of its subclasses.
    - What is the difference between throw and throws in Java?
        - The `throw` keyword in Java is used to explicitly throw an exception from a method or any block of code. The `throws` keyword is used to declare an exception.
    - What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?
        - The `finally` block is used to put important code, it will be executed whether an exception is handled or not.
    - How does Spring handle exceptions?
        - Spring provides several ways to handle exceptions. For example, using the `@ExceptionHandler` annotation to handle specific exceptions, or `@ControllerAdvice` to handle exceptions across the whole application.
    - What is ResponseEntityExceptionHandler in Spring?
        - `ResponseEntityExceptionHandler` is a convenient base class for controller advice classes. It provides methods to handle internal Spring exceptions.
