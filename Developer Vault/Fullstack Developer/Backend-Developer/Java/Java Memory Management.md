#Java-Concepts 

Java memory management relies on an automated garbage collector that reclaims memory by removing objects no longer in use, enhancing efficiency and reducing memory leaks.

Understanding of heap and stack memory, garbage collection, memory leaks, and tools for monitoring and profiling memory usage.

- **Heap Memory**: The heap is a memory area in Java where objects are dynamically allocated and managed by the garbage collector.
- **Stack Memory**: The stack is a memory area in Java used for static memory allocation, storing method call frames, local variables, and function call management.
- **Garbage Collection**: Garbage collection is an automated process in Java that identifies and removes objects no longer in use to free up memory.
- **Memory Leaks**: Memory leaks in Java occur when objects that are no longer needed are not garbage collected due to lingering references, leading to inefficient memory usage.
- **Tools for Monitoring and Profiling Memory Usage**: Tools like VisualVM, JConsole, and YourKit provide insights into Java application memory usage, helping identify performance issues and memory leaks.
