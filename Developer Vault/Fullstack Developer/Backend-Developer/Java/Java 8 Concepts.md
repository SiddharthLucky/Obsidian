### Important Upgrades in Java 8

1. **Lambda Expressions**:
    
    - Enables functional programming by allowing you to write concise code that passes behavior as an argument.
    
    ```java
    List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Jane", "Jack");
    names.forEach(name -> System.out.println(name));
    
    ```
    
    **Interview Question**: What are lambda expressions, and why are they useful in Java 8? **Answer**: Lambda expressions provide a clear and concise way to represent one method interface using an expression, which improves readability and supports functional programming.
    
2. **Stream API**:
    
    - Introduces a new abstract layer to process sequences of elements, supporting operations like map-reduce transformations.
    
    ```java
    List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Jane", "Jack");
    names.stream().filter(name -> name.startsWith("J")).forEach(System.out::println);
    
    ```
    
    **Interview Question**: What is the Stream API, and how does it enhance Java 8? **Answer**: The Stream API allows for functional-style operations on streams of elements, enabling more readable and efficient data processing.
    
3. **Default Methods**:
    
    - Allows interfaces to have methods with default implementations.
    
    ```java
    interface MyInterface {
        default void defaultMethod() {
            System.out.println("Default method");
        }
    }
    
    ```
    
    **Interview Question**: What are default methods in Java 8, and why were they introduced? **Answer**: Default methods enable interfaces to have concrete methods, which helps in extending interfaces without breaking existing implementations.
    
4. **Functional Interfaces**:
    
    - Defines an interface with a single abstract method, which can be used with lambda expressions.
    
    ```java
    @FunctionalInterface
    interface MyFunctionalInterface {
        void doSomething();
    }
    
    ```
    
    **Interview Question**: What is a functional interface in Java 8, and how is it used? **Answer**: A functional interface has exactly one abstract method and can be implemented using lambda expressions, enabling functional programming constructs.
    
5. **Optional Class**:
    
    - Provides a container that may or may not contain a non-null value, reducing the risk of `NullPointerException`.
    
    ```java
    Optional<String> optionalName = Optional.of("John");
    optionalName.ifPresent(System.out::println);
    
    ```
    
    **Interview Question**: What is the purpose of the Optional class in Java 8? **Answer**: The Optional class is used to represent optional values, providing methods to handle presence or absence of values gracefully and reducing the risk of `NullPointerException`.
    
6. **Method References**:
    
    - A shorthand notation for calling a method by referring to it with the help of its name directly.
    
    ```java
    List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Jane", "Jack");
    names.forEach(System.out::println);
    
    ```
    
    **Interview Question**: What are method references in Java 8, and how do they work? **Answer**: Method references provide a way to refer to methods directly by their names, enhancing readability and conciseness in lambda expressions.
    
7. **New Date and Time API**:
    
    - Introduces a new date and time API under `java.time` package for improved date and time manipulation.
    
    ```java
    LocalDate today = LocalDate.now();
    System.out.println(today);
    
    ```
    
    **Interview Question**: What improvements does the new Date and Time API bring in Java 8? **Answer**: The new Date and Time API provides a more comprehensive and consistent model for date and time manipulation, overcoming the limitations of the old `java.util.Date` and `java.util.Calendar` classes.
    
8. **Collectors Utility**:
    
    - Provides various implementations of reduction operations, such as accumulating elements into collections and summarizing elements.
    
    ```java
    List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Jane", "Jack");
    List<String> filteredNames = names.stream().filter(name -> name.startsWith("J")).collect(Collectors.toList());
    
    ```
    
    **Interview Question**: What are collectors in the context of Java 8 Stream API? **Answer**: Collectors are utilities used in the Stream API for performing mutable reduction operations like accumulating elements into collections or summarizing data.
    
9. **Nashorn JavaScript Engine**:
    
    - Integrates a new lightweight, high-performance JavaScript engine for embedding JavaScript code within Java applications.
    
    ```java
    ScriptEngine engine = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName("nashorn");
    engine.eval("print('Hello from JavaScript')");
    
    ```
    
    **Interview Question**: What is Nashorn in Java 8, and how is it used? **Answer**: Nashorn is a JavaScript engine that enables the execution of JavaScript code within Java applications, allowing for the integration of Java and JavaScript.
    
10. **Parallel Array Sorting**:
    
    - Adds a method for sorting arrays in parallel to improve performance on multi-core systems.
    
    ```java
    int[] numbers = {5, 3, 1, 4, 2};
    Arrays.parallelSort(numbers);
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(numbers));
    
    ```
    
    **Interview Question**: How does parallel array sorting work in Java 8? **Answer**: Parallel array sorting uses the Fork/Join framework to divide the array into smaller chunks, sorting them concurrently to leverage multi-core processors for faster performance.
    

These upgrades in Java 8 introduce significant enhancements to the language, focusing on performance, efficiency, and ease of use. Understanding these features is crucial for leveraging the full power of Java 8 in modern application development.
