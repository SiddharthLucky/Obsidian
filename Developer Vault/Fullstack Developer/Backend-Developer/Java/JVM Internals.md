In-depth knowledge of Java Virtual Machine (JVM) architecture, class loading mechanisms, Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, and performance tuning.

- **Java Virtual Machine (JVM) Architecture**: The JVM architecture includes components like the class loader, runtime data areas (heap, stack), execution engine, and garbage collector to run Java applications.
- **Class Loading Mechanisms**: Class loading mechanisms in Java involve dynamically loading, linking, and initializing classes and interfaces at runtime via the class loader subsystem.
- **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation**: JIT compilation in Java translates bytecode into native machine code at runtime, improving performance by optimizing execution.
- **Performance Tuning**: Performance tuning in Java involves optimizing the JVM settings, garbage collection strategies, and code efficiency to enhance application performance.
